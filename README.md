Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am an experimental physicist at the UBC Blusson Quantum Matter Institute, where I am pursuing my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Doug Bonn. Prior to my PhD I earned a B.A.Sc. in Engineering Physics at UBC.

I use broadband bolometric microwave spectroscopy to study the electromagnetic skin effect response in pristine single-crystal ReO<sub>3</sub> at cryogenic temperatures, to further our understanding of electrical conductivity in low-loss and anisotropic materials.

Accomplishments (Not extensive):

- Designed and implemented systematic experimental procedures for sample preparation and characterization, with documented workflows that enabled both consistent sample measurements and rapid troubleshooting of the experimental apparatus.

- Led international multi-team experiment to characterize the relationship between structural defects and electronic properties of ReO3, collaborating with beamline scientists in real-time to ensure key outcomes were met despite challenging experimental conditions. Awarded beamtime was valued at âˆ¼CA$4800.

- Developed automated data analysis framework combining electromagnetic simulations in COMSOL and Python scripting, improving experimental interpretation accuracy by ~20%, minimizing systematic sources of error, and enabling rapid sample quality validation and iteration of experimental procedures.

I am defending my dissertation this summer (2025) and am actively seeking research and engineering positions in industry. I'm especially interested in the fields of quantum computing, semiconductor engineering, radio-frequency engineering, and other fields pushing the limits of our physics and engineering capabilities.

Why do I have a GitHub portfolio even though I am trained as a physicist?

Most importantly, I want to showcase that I care about learning and implementing the best practices in fields outside of my own, such as software development, data visualization, and technical communication. This is a trait I developed in engineering physics, and still strive to develop and improve. In addition to this, I hope that the tools I develop will be helpful to others, such as scientists in my field of research. Finally, I think this work is a good example of my ability to produce clear and thorough documentation, which was developed through years of practice.

Please see the project "github.com/timothybranch/isotropic-metal-electromagnetic-skin-effect-analysis" and the files "notebooks/Skin Effect Response For an Analytic Fermi Surface.ipynb" and "src/electronic_transport.py" for the most polished examples of my work. I will continue to work on this and other projects, but right now (June 10, 2025) I have a PhD dissertation deadline that I need to hit. If you have any questions about this project, notice issues,or would like help with running it, please feel free to contact me.

I owe credit to my friends with industry experience who were generous enough to review my code and give me insights on ways I could improve it. These friends include: Joey L., Perrin W. and A.N.W.
